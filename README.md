### First step, splitting recordings with mixit

mixit has "models for Unsupervised Sound Separation of Bird Calls Using Mixture Invariant Training." We use this to take in a single recording and split it into multiple tracks, which will hopefully remove urban noise. See instructions here for downloading mixit as well as tensorflow.
